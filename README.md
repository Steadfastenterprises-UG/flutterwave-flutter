# Flutterwave Flutter SDK

# We've moved to [@Flutterwave/Flutter](https://github.com/Flutterwave/Flutter)!

We have decided to move this project to improve your experience with the library. We have no plans to support or make additional releases on this project.

If you are starting a new integration in your Flutter/Dart project or you intend to update an existing integration, use [new repo](https://github.com/Flutterwave/Flutter).

* Find out how to add the package to your project [here](https://github.com/Flutterwave/Flutter/blob/develop/README.md).
* Migrate from Old repo to the new repo.
